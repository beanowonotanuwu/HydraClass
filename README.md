I ask THAT:
  Before you read my code and as XXXTENTACION would say "literally go inside my mind" you need TO:
    Understand that this project, at the current release, has only upwards 50 hours of time spent on it
    Understand that, when reading my code, you are essentially seeing how I think and process the world around me
    Understand that this is my biggest project (regarding plugin development) so far (having started plugin development about 2 weeks before starting the project) and can be optimized greatly
  You give feedback when you feel it is needed
  When contributing, you abide by the CONTRIBUTING.md file
