IF any developers intend on forking this repository or adding to the project, I ASK THAT:
  You keep these 3 themes in mind WHEN:
    You add a skill
    You add a type of skill
    You modify a skill
    You modify a type of skill
    
   Hydras are designed around water; however, not dependent on water
   
   Treat hydras as if water amplifies their skills and lava (for the most part) restricts it
   EXCEPTIONS APPLYING:
    I would advise to be cautious WHEN:
      Creating water only skills
    Usage in lava can, should, and is allowed with skills LIKE:
      Fireball and Dragon Fireball shooting skills
      
   Final info:
    When researching the (Lernaean) Hydra (the non-winged Hydra) I decided to theme the skills AROUND:
      Shooting fireballs (projectile types = Fireball, DragonFireball)
      Inflicting negative effects on opponents (all Living Entities) INCLUDING:
        Wither
        Poison
        Fireball Fire Damage
        Dragon Fireball Fire Damage
        Dragon Fireball Dragon Breath Damage
        Slowness
        Blindness
      I advise THAT:
        Any contributers that contribute, I ask that you stay away from the FOLLOWING NEGATIVE EFFECTS:
          Hunger -> hunger does not fit well with the class
      Inflicting positive effects on opponents (only Players) INCLUDING:
        Dolphin's Grace
        Regeneration
       
       Generally I stuck to a few rules:
        If the skill is water only THEN give it a second use (this rule has exceptions)
        If I can't think of another skill, I ask myself:
          Do I need another skill?
          YES:
            Stick to the 3 themes: Shooting fireballs, inflicting positive effects on players/teamates, inflicting poison in water and wither on land
          NO:
            Then just shrug it off and move on. Remember, you can always come back
